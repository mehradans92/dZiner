## Defining Customized Agent Tools

### CO2 asorption inference and chemical feasibility assessment

We first define two tools: One for predicting CO2 adsorption, given the SMILES of the MOF's organic linker. This is our surrogate model for predicting the adsorption capacity (mol/kg). The second tool helps with predicting the chemical feasibility of the molecule, estimating the synthetic accessibility score and validity of the SMILES, based on RDKit sanitization.


```python
from dziner.tools import mol_chemical_feasibility

from langchain.agents import tool
from dziner.surrogates.MOFormer.CO2_adsorption import predict_CO2_adsorption_with_uncertainty
import torch
import numpy as np

@tool
def predict_CO2_adsoprtion(smiles):
    '''
    This tool predicts the mean CO2 Adsorption and the epistemic uncertainty in predictions for an input SMILES.
    This model is based on this paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c11420 fine-tuned on the hmof dataset.
    '''
    smiles = smiles.replace("\n", "")
    mean_prediction, std_prediction = predict_CO2_adsorption_with_uncertainty(smiles)    
    return np.round(mean_prediction, 3), np.round(std_prediction, 3)

print(f'Check chemical feasibility tool:\n{mol_chemical_feasibility.description}\n')
print(f'Predict CO2 adsoprtion tool:\n{predict_CO2_adsoprtion.description}')
```

    Check chemical feasibility tool:
    This tool inputs a SMILES of a molecule and outputs chemical feasibility, Synthetic Accessibility (SA) scores,
      molecular weight, and the SMILES. SA the ease of synthesis of compounds according to their synthetic complexity
        which combines starting materials information and structural complexity. Lower SA, means better synthesiability.

### Retrieving domain-knowledge from scientific literature

We can either include our own design constraints and guidelines or leverage the exisiting knowledge from the scientific literature. Guidelines include information of possible modulations of the core structure of the molecule or addition of elements and functional groups that can help with optimizing the property of interest.


```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
Embedding_model = 'text-embedding-3-large'

RetrievalQA_prompt = """What are the design guidelines for the making the organic linker adsorb CO2 better? 
    This can be based on making changes to the elements or the functional groups or other changes to the molecule.

    '''Useful for getting chemical intuition for the problem.
    This tool looks up design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption by looking through research papers.
    It also includes information on the paper citation or DOI.

        pages = PyPDFLoader(paper_file).load_and_split()
        sliced_pages = text_splitter.split_documents(pages)
        faiss_vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(sliced_pages, OpenAIEmbeddings(model=Embedding_model))

## Defining dZiner agent

We use Claude 3.5 Sonnet to drive our agent.


```python

tools = [predict_CO2_adsoprtion, domain_knowledge, mol_chemical_feasibility]
tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools]  
tool_desc = [tool.description for tool in tools]
agent = dZiner(tools, property="CO2 Adsoprtion",
               model=agent_model, verbose=True, n_design_iterations=5, temp=0.1,get_cost=True).agent
```


```python
initial_organic_linker =  "Nc1cc(C(=O)[O-])c(cc1c1ccc(cc1)c1c(N)cc(c(c1N)N)C(=O)[O-])N(C)C#N" 
Human_prompt = f"Make changes to the organic linker {initial_organic_linker} to increase its CO2 adsroption. Suggest 20 new candidates."

    [32;1m[1;3mThought: To begin, I need to look up design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption. Then, I'll evaluate the initial molecule and start making changes based on the guidelines.
    
    Action: domain_knowledge
    Action Input: design guidelines for organic linkers with higher CO2 adsorption
    [0m
    Observation: [33;1m[1;3mTo design organic linkers that adsorb CO2 more effectively, several guidelines can be followed:
    
    1. **Functional Group Modification**: Introducing different functional groups such as -OSO3H, -NO2, -OH, -NH2, and other polar groups like -N=C(R)-, -N=N- can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption. These groups improve the interaction between CO2 and the organic linkers, thereby increasing the selectivity and stability of the frameworks.
    
    2. **Pore Size and Shape Optimization**: Adjusting the pore size and shape of the MOFs can enhance CO2 capture by providing more adsorption sites and promoting effective screening of molecules. Fine-tuning the pore aperture size is crucial for selective adsorption of CO2 over other gases.
    
    3. **Open Metal Sites (OMS)**: Incorporating unsaturated open metal sites in the MOF structure can enhance CO2 adsorption due to favorable interactions between the metal sites and the CO2 quadrupole moment.
    
    4. **Basicity**: Since CO2 is an acidic molecule, MOFs with basic metal oxide nodes can present more basic sites for CO2 adsorption. This can be achieved by using metal oxides with a small charge-to-radius ratio, which are more ionic in character.
    
    These strategies are discussed in the paper titled "Advanced Strategies in Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Separation," published in *The Chemical Record* in 2022. The DOI for this paper is 10.1002/tcr.202100230. To enhance CO2 adsorption by the organic linker in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the following design guidelines can be considered:
    
    1. **Incorporation of Polar Functionalities**: Introducing polar functional groups such as aromatic amines, imines, and amides can enhance CO2 interactions due to their ability to form strong bonds with CO2 molecules.
    2. **Heteroatomic Sites**: Using linkers with heteroatoms like nitrogen in triazoles, pyridines, or other similar groups can create multiple interaction points for CO2, thus increasing uptake.
    3. **Alkylamine Functionalization**: Grafting alkylamines (primary, secondary, or tertiary) onto the linker can significantly improve CO2 chemisorption, especially under humid conditions.
    4. **Hydrophobicity and Pore Metrics**: Designing linkers that contribute to the hydrophobicity of the framework or optimizing pore sizes to match the kinetic diameter of CO2 can enhance selective CO2 capture.
    5. **Defect Engineering**: Introducing defects in the linker structure can increase the number of active sites available for CO2 adsorption.
    
    These strategies are discussed in detail in the paper titled "The chemistry and applications of metal-organic frameworks," DOI: 10.1126/science.1230444, published in *Science* in 2013. To design an organic linker that adsorbs CO2 better, consider the following guidelines:
    
    1. **Increase the Density of Open Metal Sites**: Using smaller ligands can reduce the channel diameter and increase the volumetric density of open metal sites, which enhances CO2 adsorption. For example, replacing larger aromatic ligands with smaller aliphatic ligands like 2,3-dihydroxyfumarate (DHFUMA) can improve CO2 binding energetics.
    
    2. **Optimize Binding Energetics**: The binding mode where one CO2 molecule interacts with two adjacent metal sites can significantly enhance binding strength. This can be achieved by reducing the distance between adjacent open metal sites in the pore channel.
    
    3. **Functional Group Selection**: Incorporating functional groups that can form strong interactions with CO2, such as hydroxyl groups, can improve adsorption. The presence of such groups can increase the binding energy and selectivity for CO2 over other gases like H2O.
    
    4. **Temperature and Humidity Tolerance**: Select materials and functional groups that maintain high CO2 uptake even at elevated temperatures and in the presence of moisture. This is crucial for applications involving flue gas streams.
    
    5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Using commercially available and cheaper aliphatic ligands can reduce the overall cost of the MOF, making it more viable for industrial applications.
    
    These guidelines are based on the findings from the paper titled "Rational Design of a Low-Cost, High-Performance Metal-Organic Framework for Hydrogen Storage and Carbon Capture," published in *The Journal of Physical Chemistry C* in 2017, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363. To design organic linkers that adsorb CO₂ more effectively, several strategies can be employed:
    
    1. **Metal Decoration**: Decorating the linkers with metal atoms, such as lithium, can significantly enhance the adsorption strength due to increased electrostatic interactions and polarization effects.
    
    2. **Functionalization**: Introducing functional groups like fluorine and chlorine can improve the interaction between CO₂ and the linker by increasing the electrostatic interaction and quadrupole moment.
    
    3. **Surface Area and Pore Volume**: Increasing the length of the organic linkers can enhance the surface area and pore volume of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which in turn improves gas adsorption capacity. However, this must be balanced with maintaining the structural stability of the MOFs.
    
    4. **Hydrophobicity**: Designing hydrophobic linkers can be beneficial for CO₂ capture in humid environments, as it minimizes competitive water adsorption.
    
    5. **Thermal and Chemical Stability**: Ensuring that the linkers and the resulting MOFs have high thermal and chemical stability is crucial for practical applications, especially under harsh conditions.
    
    These guidelines are based on the findings from the study titled "Designing organic bridging linkers of metal–organic frameworks for enhanced carbon dioxide adsorption," published in the New Journal of Chemistry, 2024. DOI: 10.1039/d4nj01197j.[0m

    This response summarizes the process of modifying the initial organic linker to improve its CO2 adsorption. It includes:
    
    1. The initial molecule's properties
    2. Four modified molecules with their properties and modifications
    3. The best performing molecule
    4. Key design guidelines used
    5. Sources for the tools and guidelines used
    
    The best performing molecule was created by adding a fluorine atom, which increased the CO2 adsorption from 0.885 to 1.426. All modified molecules showed improved CO2 adsorption compared to the initial molecule, while maintaining chemical feasibility and reasonable synthetic accessibility scores.[0m
