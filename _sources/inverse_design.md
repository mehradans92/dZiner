## Example 5 - WDR5 Ligand Inverse Design

In this example, we take a look at identifying molecules with high binding affinity against WDR5 protein tagert. WDR5 is a key protein involved in chromatin remodeling, serving as a core component of the COMPASS complex, which regulates histone methylation and plays a crucial role in gene expression, making it a significant target for cancer and epigenetic therapies.
We set the inverse design criteria to design potential molecules with a docking score of -9 ¬± 0.5 kcal/mol.

### Defining Agent Tools

The ReAct agent can be augmented with many different tools depneding on your problem. Here, we load Google search tool with `SERPER API` and a docking score predictor with [GNINA](https://github.com/gnina/gnina). GNINA can be downloaded as a linux binary and made executable (see this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QYo5QLUE80N_G28PlpYs6OKGddhhd931?usp=sharing) for installation). The live Google search tool allows the model to find information on how to interact with WDR5 binding, and guide the possible adaptation to the core structure of the molecule. You also can define your own cutom tools for the agent (check other examples [here](https://mehradans92.github.io/dZiner/))

SUFFIX = """You should always follow these steps:

    2. Evaluate the docking of the initial molecule you start with.
    3. Start making changes to the molecule based on guidelines you found in step 1. Try to use different changes at each iteration.

    Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: Based on the search results, I've gathered some important information about WDR5 inhibitors and their structural features. Although specific design guidelines weren't provided, I can infer some key points:
    
    1. Most WDR5 inhibitors target the WIN (WDR5-interaction) site.
    2. The WIN site is a pocket that binds to an arginine-containing WIN motif in partner proteins.
    3. There's also a shallow hydrophobic cleft called the "WBM" (WDR5-binding motif) site.
    4. Some inhibitors feature bicyclic heteroaryl P7 units.
    5. Structure-based design has been used to develop WDR5 inhibitors.
    
    Now, I'll start by evaluating an initial molecule and then make iterative changes based on these insights.

    Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: The initial molecule has a docking score of -6.69, which is higher than our target range of -9¬±0.5. We need to modify the structure to improve its binding affinity. Based on the information gathered, I'll make some changes to potentially enhance its interaction with the WIN site of WDR5.
    
    1. Add an arginine-like moiety to mimic the WIN motif
    2. Incorporate a bicyclic heteroaryl group
    3. Increase overall hydrophobicity
    
    Let's start by adding an arginine-like group:

    Thought:[32;1m[1;3mThought: Here's your final answer:
    
    Final Answer: Based on the iterative design process and docking score predictions, I have successfully identified two molecules that meet the criteria of having a docking score of -9¬±0.5 against the WDR5 protein target. Here are the two candidates:
    
    1. CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=NN=C(O2)C3=C4C=CC=CC4=NC(=C3)CCCNC(=N)N
       Docking score: -8.59
    
    2. CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C2=NN=C(O2)C3=C4C=CC=CC4=NC(=C3)CCCNC(=N)NC(=O)C
       Docking score: -9.37
    
    Both molecules were designed based on the following structural features that contribute to WDR5 binding:
    
    1. Targeting the WIN (WDR5-interaction) site
    2. Incorporating an arginine-like moiety to mimic the WIN motif
    3. Including a bicyclic heteroaryl group
    4. Maintaining overall hydrophobicity
    
    The design process involved iterative modifications and evaluation of docking scores using the predictGNINA_docking tool, which is based on GNINA as described in the paper: https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-021-00522-2
    
    It's important to note that while specific design guidelines were not available in the literature search, the structural features incorporated were inferred from general information about WDR5 inhibitors and their binding characteristics.
    
    These molecules represent potential starting points for further optimization and experimental validation as WDR5 inhibitors.[0m
