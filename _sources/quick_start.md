## Quick start

In this example, we take a look at increasing the binding affinity of a drug molecule agaist DRD2 protein target. The DRD2 protein refers to the dopamine D2 receptor, a type of G protein-coupled receptor found predominantly in the brain. It plays a crucial role in modulating neurotransmission by binding dopamine, influencing motor control, reward pathways, and various cognitive functions. Due to its significant involvement in these processes, the DRD2 receptor is a key target for medications treating neurological and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

### Defining Agent Tools

The ReAct agent can be augmented with many different tools depneding on your problem. Here, we load Google search tool with `SERPER API` and a docking score predictor with AutoDock Vina. AutoDock Vina is an open-source molecular docking software used in computational drug discovery to predict how small molecules bind to receptor proteins with known 3D structures, estimating interaction strengths and binding modes. The live Google search tool allows the model to find information on how to interact with DRD2 binding, and guide the possible adaptation to the core structure of the molecule. You also can define your own cutom tools for the agent (check other examples [here](https://mehradans92.github.io/dZiner/)) 


```python
from dziner.tools import search, predict_docking_score_DRD2
print(f'Search tool:\n{search.description}\n')

print(f'DRD2 docking eval tool:\n{predict_docking_score_DRD2.description}')
```

    Search tool:
    This tool performs a search on Google using SerpAPI and returns relevant information for the query.
    It is useful for retrieving information from the web or when you need to look up current data.
    
    DRD2 docking eval tool:
    This tool predicts the docking score to DRD2 for a SMILES molecule. Lower docking score means a larger binding affinity.
    This model is based on Autodock Vina from this paper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01334



```python
from dziner.agents import dZiner

tools = [predict_docking_score_DRD2, search]
tool_names = [tool.name for tool in tools]  
tool_desc = [tool.description for tool in tools]
agent = dZiner(tools, property="Binding affinity",
               model='gpt-4o', verbose=True, n_design_iterations=1, temp=0.1,get_cost=True).agent
```

Just as a demostration, we choose Asprin as the initial candidate and have dZiner make changes to increase binding affinity against DRD2.


```python
initial_molecule = "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O" # this is Asprin
Human_prompt = f"Make changes to {initial_molecule} so it will have a larger binding affinity against DRD2 target."

input_data = {
            "input": Human_prompt,
            "tools": tools,
            "tool_names": tool_names,
            "tool_desc": tool_desc
        }

result = agent.invoke(input_data)
```

    Based on the search results, here are some summarized design guidelines for optimizing binding affinity against DRD2:
    
    1. **Extended Binding Pocket**: DRD2 has an extended binding pocket that can be exploited for better binding affinity (DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01334).
    2. **Structure-Based and Ligand-Based Methods**: Utilize complementary structure-based and ligand-based methods for optimization.
    3. **Functional Group Modifications**: Adding or modifying functional groups to improve interactions with the binding site.
    4. **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Enhancing hydrophobic interactions within the binding pocket can improve binding affinity.
    5. **Aromatic Interactions**: Leveraging Ï€-Ï€ stacking interactions with aromatic residues in the binding site.

    The initial molecule, CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O, is a valid SMILES string representing aspirin. It is a well-known and valid chemical structure.
    
    ### Step 4: Make Changes to the Molecule Based on Guidelines
    
    Based on the design guidelines, I will start by making a simple modification to the molecule to enhance hydrophobic interactions. I will replace the acetyl group with a more hydrophobic group, such as a phenyl group.
    
    New SMILES: COC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O

    ### Step 7: Iterate with a Different Modification
    
    Since the binding affinity did not improve, I will revert to the initial molecule and try a different modification. This time, I will add a functional group to enhance aromatic interactions. I will add a methoxy group to the aromatic ring.
    
    New SMILES: CC(=O)OC1=CC=C(C=C1)OC(=O)O

    ### Step 7: Iterate with a Different Modification
    
    Since the binding affinity improved slightly, I will continue to explore further modifications. This time, I will add a hydrophobic group to the aromatic ring to enhance hydrophobic interactions. I will add a tert-butyl group to the aromatic ring.
    
    New SMILES: CC(=O)OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)(C)C
