# Example 3 - Low CMC Surfactant Design

Surfactant molecules play important roles in a wide variety of disciplines of study, from lubricants
and coating to pharmaceuticals and drug delivery systems. This wide applicability of study is
due to the role of surfactant molecules act as compatibilizers between dissimilar materials phases.
While there are many metrics that are used to characterize surfactant molecules, the most common
is the critical micelle concentration (CMC). CMC is traditionally the experimentally determined
concentration at which individual surfactant molecules will self-assemble into larger aggregates
(micelles). This value is critically important as the desirable properties of surfactants (solubilizing
differing phases, enabling biocompatibility etc.) are typically only enabled when the solution
concentration of the surfactant is above the CMC. To design surfactant molecules with a desired
CMC, the task is often challenging and relies heavily on domain-knowledge based expertise. Hence,
the design task of minimizing CMC is both well-suited for an LLM agent, and a desirable objective
to reduce the reliance on domain expertise for chemical synthesis.

## Defining Customized Agent Tools

### Setting up the CMC predictor

This model is based on the work of [Qin et al.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c05264) without any adaptations. The authors used a
Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) to predict the critical micelle concentration (CMC)
of surfactants based on their molecular structure as SMILES input. The CMC training data were
experimentally measured at room temperature (between 20 and 25 °C) in water for 202 surfactants
coming from various classes, including nonionic, cationic, anionic, and zwitterionic. The model
architecture leverages graph convolutional layers to process molecular graphs, where atoms are
represented as nodes and bonds as edges, effectively capturing both topological and constitutional
information. The GCN includes average pooling to aggregate atom-level features into a fixed-size
graph-level vector, followed by fully connected layers with ReLU activations for the final regression
of the log CMC value. In terms of performance, the GCN has a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE)
of 0.23 and an R2 of 0.96 on test data for nonionic surfactants, outperforming previous quantitative
structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. The ensemble of models used in our study are based
on an 11-fold cross-validation with mean RMSE of 0.32. For more details on the model, refer to
reference
See [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c05264) for more details on the surrogate model.

    Action Input: Design guidelines for molecules with lower Critical Micelle Concentration
    [0m
    Observation: [36;1m[1;3mThe design guidelines for creating surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involve manipulating the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tails and headgroups. Key strategies include:
    
    1. **Hydrophobic Tail Structure**: The chemical nature and structure of the hydrophobic tails significantly influence the CMC. For instance, fluorocarbon surfactants have lower CMCs due to their larger molecular volume and lower polarizability compared to hydrocarbons. Similarly, branching in hydrocarbon tails can reduce the CMC by increasing the packing density at the interface.
    
    2. **Headgroup Modifications**: The type and charge of the headgroup can also affect the CMC. Adjusting the headgroup can alter the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, influencing the surfactant's ability to form micelles.
    
    3. **Chain Length and Branching**: Increasing the chain length generally decreases the CMC, as longer chains enhance hydrophobic interactions. Branching can also be used to achieve lower surface tensions and CMCs by promoting dense packing of the surfactant molecules at the interface.
    
    4. **Substitution with Low-Surface-Energy Groups**: Incorporating groups like methyl (CH3) at the chain termini can lower the surface energy and CMC, mimicking the architecture of effective siloxane surfactants.
    
    These guidelines are based on the understanding that the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, as well as the molecular packing at the interface, are crucial for determining the CMC and overall efficiency of surfactants.
    
    Reference: "Surfactants at the Design Limit," DOI: 10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b00336, Langmuir, 2015. Design guidelines for making surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involve modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head. Key strategies include:
    
    1. **Tail Length and Branching**: Shortening the hydrophobic tail generally increases the CMC. Additionally, converting a linear alkyl chain into a branched one can also increase the CMC.
    
    2. **Head Group Modifications**: Increasing the size of the hydrophilic head or adding polar groups to the head can lead to a higher CMC.
    
    3. **Aromatic Modifications**: Breaking π bonds in aromatic rings, such as converting a benzene ring to a cyclohexane group, can lower the CMC due to reduced polarity.
    
    These guidelines are based on the understanding that the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts of the surfactant molecule influences the CMC. The guidelines are supported by predictions from Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and COSMOmic calculations, which have shown consistent trends with experimental observations.
    
    Reference:
    - Title: "Predicting Critical Micelle Concentrations with Molecular Dynamics Simulations and COSMOmic"
    - DOI: 10.1002/cite.201700129
    - Journal: Chemie Ingenieur Technik, 2017 The design guidelines for making surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involve modifying the molecular structure, particularly the functional groups and branching. The study suggests that the CMC value is influenced by the molecular connectivity indices, which represent the structure of the surfactant. Specifically, the first-order valence molecular connectivity index (1χν) and the second-order molecular connectivity index (2χ) are crucial. The 1χν index decreases with increased branching, while the 2χ index increases with branching. Therefore, to design surfactants with a desired CMC, one can adjust the branching and the type of functional groups in the molecule. For example, changing spacer groups can affect the CMC, as seen in the order of increasing CMC values: –CH2– < –NH– < –O– for straight chains, and –CH3 < –NH2 < –OH for branched groups.
    
    Reference: "Prediction of critical micelle concentration of cationic surfactants using connectivity indices," DOI: 10.1007/s10910-010-9738-7, Journal of Mathematical Chemistry, 2011. Designing surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves modifying the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. Here are some guidelines based on the literature:
    
    1. **Hydrophobic Tail Modifications**: Increasing the length of the hydrophobic tail generally decreases the CMC. This is because longer hydrophobic chains enhance the tendency of surfactant molecules to aggregate into micelles. 
    
    2. **Hydrophilic Head Modifications**: The nature and size of the hydrophilic head group can significantly affect the CMC. For instance, increasing the size or charge of the head group can increase the CMC due to enhanced solubility in water.
    
    3. **Branching and Saturation**: Introducing branching in the hydrophobic tail or using unsaturated chains can influence the CMC. Branching typically increases the CMC, while unsaturation can either increase or decrease it depending on the specific structure.
    
    4. **Functional Groups**: Adding functional groups that can participate in hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions can alter the CMC. For example, introducing ether or ester linkages can increase the hydrophilicity and thus the CMC.
    
    5. **Aromatic Rings**: Incorporating aromatic rings in the hydrophobic tail can decrease the CMC due to π-π interactions that promote aggregation.
    
    These guidelines are derived from quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) studies, which correlate molecular descriptors with CMC values. For more detailed insights, refer to the study titled "Prediction of critical micelle concentration using a quantitative structure–property relationship approach" published in the Journal of Colloid Interface Science in 1997 (DOI: 10.1006/jcis.1997.4778). Designing a surfactant with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involves manipulating the molecular structure, particularly the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic headgroup. Here are some guidelines based on the literature:
    
    1. **Tail Length and Structure**: Increasing the length of the hydrocarbon tail generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance hydrophobic interactions, promoting micelle formation. Linear tails are more effective than branched ones in reducing CMC. 
    
    2. **Headgroup Size and Type**: The size and type of the headgroup significantly affect the CMC. Larger headgroups or those with strong polar or ionic characteristics can increase the CMC due to steric hindrance or electrostatic repulsion. Nonionic surfactants typically have lower CMCs compared to ionic ones.
    
    3. **Counterions**: For ionic surfactants, the type of counterion can influence the CMC. Surfactants with larger or more polarizable counterions tend to have lower CMCs.
    
    4. **Functional Groups**: Introducing functional groups that enhance hydrogen bonding or other specific interactions can modify the CMC. For example, adding ethylene oxide units can increase the hydrophilicity of the headgroup, affecting the CMC.
    
    These guidelines are derived from the study of various surfactant systems and their micellization behavior. For more detailed insights, refer to the paper titled "Analyzing the Accuracy of Critical Micelle Concentration Predictions Using Deep Learning," DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00868, published in the Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation in 2023. The design guidelines for making surfactants with a specific Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) involve modifications to the molecular structure, particularly focusing on the hydrophobic tail length, head group area, and the presence of functional groups. Key factors include:
    
    1. **Hydrophobic Tail Length**: Increasing the hydrophobic tail length generally decreases the CMC, as longer tails enhance the hydrophobic interactions that drive micelle formation.
    
    2. **Head Group Area**: The size and nature of the head group can influence the CMC. Larger or more polar head groups can increase the CMC due to increased repulsion between head groups.
    
    3. **Functional Groups**: Introducing or modifying functional groups can alter the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, thus affecting the CMC. For example, adding ethylene oxide units can increase hydrophilicity and potentially increase the CMC.
    
    4. **Spacer Groups**: In Gemini surfactants, the spacer group connecting the two hydrophobic tails can be adjusted to optimize the CMC.
    
    These design principles are discussed in the context of surfactant properties and their impact on CMC in the paper titled "QSPR for the prediction of critical micelle concentration of different classes of surfactants using machine learning algorithms," published in the Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling, 2024.

This aligns with the design guideline suggesting that fluorocarbon surfactants can have lower CMCs due to their larger molecular volume and lower polarizability. Let's continue exploring modifications to see if we can further lower the CMC. We'll try introducing a branched structure near the head group, which might affect the packing of the molecules at the interface.
